Given the following structure description: 

A course is a structure that contains:
     a list of students
     a list of instructors

A student is a structure that contains:
      a student username
      a student id
      section number
      an array of 10 integers for 10 assignments grade
      an array of 3 integers for 3 midterms
      an integer for the final grade (40% assignments, 20% each midterm)

An instructor is a structure that contains:
      name (string), section number.
       you may assume that each instructor teaches one section

This is an open question, so you decide on the implementation, the header of each function, the assumptions, etc.

Write functions that support the following:

1) creating a course
2) destroying a course
3) adding a student to the course (given student id and student username, and section number)
4) adding an instructor to the course(given instructor name, section number)
5) removing a student from the course (given student id)
5) adding assignment grade to certain student (given student username, assignment number, and the grade)
6) adding a midterm grade to a particular student (given student username, midterm number, and the grade)
7) calculating and updating the final grade of a specific student (given student username), assuming that all grades for assignments and midterms are valid.
8) print students' usernames and their final grades sorted by username for all sections
9) print students' usernames who failed the course in a given section
10) you can add any function you like for practising

Testing is critical; test all different cases and test for memory leaks.
